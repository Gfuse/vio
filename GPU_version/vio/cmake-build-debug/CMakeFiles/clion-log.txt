-- Could not find the required component 'robot_localization'. The following CMake error indicates that you either need to install the package with the same name or change your environment so that it can be found.
CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "robot_localization" with any of the following names:

    robot_localizationConfig.cmake
    robot_localization-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "robot_localization" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "robot_localization_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "robot_localization" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
